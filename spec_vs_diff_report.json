  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive premium redesign covering most of the requirements: Lucide icons replacing emojis (REQ-13), multi-accent colour palette with CSS custom properties and Tailwind tokens (REQ-14), glassmorphism card design (REQ-15), premium Hero section (REQ-16), upgraded Navbar (REQ-17), improved typography/spacing (REQ-18), Mess Menu redesign with accent colours and Lucide icons (REQ-19), and Quick Access tile redesign with gradient icon containers (REQ-20). Almost all acceptance criteria appear to be met, with one notable gap around the Navbar dropdown teal accent bars which are referenced via a CSS class but not fully confirmed in truncated output.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Dropdown nav links should have left-side teal accent bars on hover",
      "reason": "The Navbar.tsx applies class 'nav-link-hover' to mobile dropdown links and the index.css summary mentions nav-link hover effects, but the actual CSS rule defining the left-side teal bar is in the truncated portion of index.css and cannot be confirmed. Desktop nav links use only inline colour change handlers with no visible left-side bar implementation.",
