## Summary
**Goal:** Premium visual redesign of the unaIITM frontend — replacing emojis with Lucide icons, introducing a multi-accent colour palette, and applying a glassmorphism + bold gradient luxury aesthetic across all sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all emoji icons across every section (Quick Access, Mess Menu, Events, Notices, Navbar, BottomPanel, Modal) with contextually appropriate Lucide React SVG icons sized at 20–24px
- Upgrade the global colour palette to a multi-accent system: forest green as dominant base with amber/gold, teal, and emerald accents applied contextually; update CSS custom properties and Tailwind config accordingly
- Redesign all card components (Quick Access tiles, Mess Menu, Event, Notice cards) with deep green-tinted glassmorphism, bold layered gradients, 18px border-radius, emerald rim border, generous padding, layered box-shadows, and clear typography hierarchy
- Overhaul the Hero section with a deep multi-stop radial gradient background, emerald-to-amber gradient text on the heading, a glassmorphism pill subtitle badge, 56px+ heading size, and subtle ambient glow orbs
- Upgrade the Navbar with stronger backdrop-blur, deep rgba background, emerald-to-amber gradient logo text, Lucide Menu icon replacing the hamburger, and teal accent bars on dropdown hover
- Improve global spacing and typography: section titles 26–30px with gradient underline, muted subtitles, 64px+ vertical section spacing, line-height 1.65, letter-spacing -0.01em on headings, and generous padding in BottomPanel and Modal list items
- Redesign Mess Menu cards with distinct accent colour header strips (amber for Breakfast, emerald for Lunch, teal for Dinner), Lucide meal icons, styled food item lists with divider lines, and timing badges
- Redesign Quick Access tiles with gradient icon containers (44px circles), white Lucide icons, 12px semi-bold labels, subtle canopy-patterned row background, and premium BottomPanel headers with Lucide icon, gradient title, and Lucide X close button

**User-visible outcome:** The app has a dramatically more premium, high-end appearance with consistent Lucide icons throughout, a rich multi-accent green palette, glassmorphism cards, an overhauled hero and navbar, and refined typography and spacing across all sections.
